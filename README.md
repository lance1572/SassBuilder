# SassBuilder
Sublime Text Package for Dart Sass. 

This is a Sublime plugin to compile your Sass using Dart Sass. This is my first attempt at creating a plugin and I'm sure that there are somethings to be improved upon. This is for Mac but i'm sure it could work for Windows and Linux with some path adjustments. So be forewarned.

**I am not supporting this so use at your own risk. It may OR may not work for you.**

## Mac

*This is an unzipped package which goes into the Sublime Text Packages folder. Dump the folder in there and restart ST*
