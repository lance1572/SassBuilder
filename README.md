# SassBuilder
Sublime Text Package for Dart Sass. 

This is a Sublime plugin to compile your Sass using Dart Sass. This is my first attempt at creating a plugin and I'm sure that there are somethings to be improved upon. 

**I am not supporting this so use at your own risk. It may OR may not work for you.**

- Download Dart Sass, move to preferred directory
- Add the location to the executable to the settings file `SassBuilder.sublime-settings`
- Make a folder in your project - sass, scss or whatever
- Add that folder name to the settings as well
- Customize the name of your output folder
- Go to Tools > Build
